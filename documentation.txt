The relationship between Factor vs. Time:
There is an exponential growth in the plot as time increases which is seen by the plot.

The relationship between Pi and Time:
In the plot, Pi begins at around 3.14 and then sudden increases 30 minutes in, and then quickly falls and stabilize again
at around 3.14 for the remaining duration of time.

The relationship between Factor vs. Pi:
Lastly, the Pi value starts at 4.0 and decreases at a steady rate across the hour duration and ends at around a pi value
of 3.14.

In conclusion, a positive correlation is evident between the time and factor variables, indicating
exponential growth as time progresses. However, the relationships between time and pi, as well as pi and factor,
appear to be minimal, with pi maintaining a relatively constant value despite increases in both time and factor variables.
